# concentration

This game is meant to be a practice for working with Github as a team. 

It is very unlikely to be finished, but on the off chance it is, do enjoy the shoddy code made by first year developers in Swift.

Now the app is supposed to be a game called concentration. Flip all the tiles over and you win. Given enough time, anyone can win.
This is an easy game, but still good practice for making a game that is interactable.
